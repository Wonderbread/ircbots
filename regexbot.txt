regexbot
========

A simple IRC bot that keeps a rotating list of messages to perform regular expressions on.

It has a configuration file with INI-like syntax, all of it is described in 'regexbot.example.ini'.  By default, the bot will try to read a configuration file specified on the commandline, or 'regexbot.ini' if none is specified.

It records all messages it sees, except regular expressions.  You perform a substitution like this:

  s/original/replacement/
  
It only supports the 'i' (case insensitive) option, and is always greedy (g-option).  It has perl-compatible regular expressions.

Escaping forward slashes is not supported, instead represent a forward slash with the octal escape sequence \057.

The bot features an ignore-list and "cooldown ignore timer", so it will ignore people with a hostmask you specify (as a regular expression, of course), and also ignore those when too many commands are sent.
